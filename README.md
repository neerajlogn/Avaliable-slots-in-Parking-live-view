# Avaliable-slots-in-Parking-live-view
This project is a real time parking view . It turns out that this is a relatively easy problem to solve using image processing and OpenCV. All that is needed is an aerial shot of the parking lot whicch can be taken from the Drone or from the 360 degree camera .
The main idea is to detect the parking slots avaliable and it can be easily done with gray image . After detction of the vacant slots we will be displaying it on a Monitor . 
Special Thanks o murtaza for the image processing video ..
